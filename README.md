# snakeware
snakeware is a free Linux distro with a Python userspace inspired by the Commodore 64. You are booted directly into a
Python interpreter, which you can use to do whatever you want with your computer.

## Motivation
The idea is that a Python OS would be fun to use and very easy to contribute to. Even relative beginners might be able
to find ways to meaningfully contribute apps and other code to this distro.

Our window manager, snakewm, is based on pygame/pygame_gui. We do not use X11; snakewm draws directly to `/dev/fb0`. For improved performance, snakewm now supports hardware-accelerated graphics via SDL2's KMS/DRM driver and Mesa for OpenGL/ES rendering, enabling smoother UI and better GPU utilization on supported hardware (e.g., Intel/AMD on x86 or VideoCore on Raspberry Pi).

We also are not going to be using any other huge and opaque software such as systemd, etc. The goal is to eventually
have a usable set of userspace apps and utilities written entirely in Python, because Python is fun and it Just Werksâ„¢.

## Running
[Download the latest release image.](https://github.com/joshiemoore/snakeware/releases)

You can burn the x86-64 ISO file to a flash drive and boot it, or launch the ISO in VirtualBox. Instructions to run it 
in QEMU are below.

The rpi4 image can be flashed to an SD card and run on your Raspberry Pi 4, with no further setup required.

### Flash Drive / SD Card

To run snakeware on real hardware, simply write the image file to the flash drive or SD card using `dd`, then boot it.
No further setup is required if you just need a live, non-persistent environment.

### Creating a Persistent Partition
[Video Tutorial Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBbr9N1TIqQ)

1. Note the virtual device corresponding to the drive you wrote the snakeware image to. For this example, we will
assume `/dev/sdc`.
2. Use `cfdisk` to add another partition to the drive, after the snakeware partition. This partition can be any size, but you'll likely want to fill the rest of the drive. Take note of the number of the new partition. This will be your "snakeuser" partition, where all of your scripts and data will be stored.
3. Once you have written the partition to the drive, format the partition to ext4. For example, `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc2`.
4. Finally, give the paritition the SNAKEUSER label, ex: `e2label /dev/sdc2 SNAKEUSER`.

Once you've completed these steps, the snakeuser partition will be automatically mounted as `/snakeuser` and chdir'd
into on boot. Files and data stored on this partition will persist between boots.

### QEMU

To run snakeware on QEMU:

1. [Download and install QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/).
2. Open your terminal/command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory/folder where the snakeware image image was downloaded.
4. Launch the snakeware ISO using a script similar to this:
```
RAM="2G"
ISO="snakeware_x86-64.iso"

AUDIO="pa" # also available: alsa

exec qemu-system-x86_64 \
        -drive file="$ISO",media=cdrom,if=virtio \
        -m "$RAM" \
        -cpu host \
        -machine type=q35,accel=kvm \
        -smp $(nproc) \
        -audiodev "$AUDIO,id=snd" \
        -device ich9-intel-hda \
        -device hda-output,audiodev=snd
```
5. Wait for it to load.
6. You will be be taken to a Python environment/shell.

### VirtualBox

To run snakeware on VirtualBox:

1. [Download and install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2. Open and create a new virtual machine with `Type: Linux` and `Version: Other Linux (64-bit)`.
3. Set virtual hard disk size and RAM (recommended 2GB) to your liking.
4. After snakeware VM is created, open vm settings, go to `Storage`.
5. Click small disk icon next to `Controller: IDE`, then `Add`.
6. Add `snakeware.iso` and click `Choose`
7. Go to `Display` and set `Graphics Controller: ` to `VBoxVGA`
8. Click `Okay` and then `Start` to run VM.
9. You will be loaded into a Python environment/shell.

### Launching snakewm

To load snakewm from Python shell:

1. Launch snakewm with either of the following Python commands:
```
>>> snakewm
```
or
```
>>> from snakewm.wm import SnakeWM
>>> SnakeWM().run()
```
2. To open the app menu press the Super key.

To enable hardware acceleration in snakewm (if built with the updated defconfig), set environment variables before launching:
```
import os
os.environ['SDL_VIDEODRIVER'] = 'kmsdrm'
os.environ['SDL_VIDEO_GL_DRIVER'] = 'libGL.so'  # Or 'libGLESv2.so' for GLES
```
Modify `snakewm/wm.py` for permanent integration, e.g., add OpenGL flags to Pygame display setup.

## Building
GNU/Linux is the only supported development platform for snakeware. If you encounter build errors while trying
to build on Windows or macOS, please ensure the error is reproducible in a GNU/Linux environment before opening
an issue.

The snakeware build system is based on buildroot. See the `snakeware/` directory in this repo for resources and
documentation on how to build your own snakeware distro image.

### Building on Windows with WSL
Building on Windows requires WSL (Ubuntu recommended) due to Linux dependencies. Follow these steps to address common issues like line endings, paths, version mismatches, and patches.

1. Install WSL and Ubuntu: In PowerShell (Admin), run `wsl --install`. Launch Ubuntu and set up.
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install -y which sed make binutils build-essential diffutils gcc g++ bash patch gzip bzip2 perl tar cpio unzip rsync file bc findutils gawk wget git python3 ncurses-base libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev flex bison libssl-dev libelf-dev curl mercurial subversion cvs graphviz libglib2.0-dev libexpat1-dev autopoint gettext docbook2x lzop gengetopt zlib1g-dev
   sudo apt install dos2unix
   ```
3. Clone or move repo to WSL home (avoids /mnt/c path issues):  
   ```
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/joshiemoore/snakeware.git  # Or mv /mnt/c/path/to/snakeware ~
   cd snakeware
   ```
4. Fix line endings:  
   ```
   dos2unix build.sh
   find external -name "Config.in" -exec dos2unix {} \;
   dos2unix external/external.desc
   dos2unix external/post-build.sh
   chmod +x build.sh
   ```
5. Upgrade Meson to 1.4.1 (for GLib compatibility):  
   ```
   cd buildroot_x86-64/package/meson
   # Edit meson.mk: MESON_VERSION=1.4.1, MESON_SITE=https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases/download/$(MESON_VERSION), MESON_SOURCE=meson-$(MESON_VERSION).tar.gz
   # Edit meson.hash: sha256 1b8aad738a5f6ae64294cc8eaba9a82988c1c420204484ac02ef782e5bba5f49  meson-1.4.1.tar.gz
   cd ../..
   make host-meson-dirclean
   make host-meson
   ```
6. Manually download Meson tarball (if 404 on mirrors):  
   ```
   cd dl
   wget https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases/download/1.4.1/meson-1.4.1.tar.gz
   cd ..
   make host-meson-dirclean
   make
   ```
7. Fix GLib compilation in gspawn.c:  
   ```
   # Edit output/build/host-libglib2-2.68.2/glib/gspawn.c: Change "close_range (lowfd, G_MAXUINT)" to "close_range (lowfd, G_MAXUINT, 0)"
   make
   ```
8. Remove failing Meson patches (not needed for shared libs):  
   ```
   rm package/meson/0001-Prefer-ext-static-libs-when-default-library-static.patch
   rm package/meson/0002-mesonbuild-dependencies-base.py-add-pkg_config_stati.patch
   make host-meson-dirclean
   make host-meson
   make
   ```
9. Clean Meson site-packages (for import errors):  
   ```
   make host-meson-dirclean
   rm -rf output/host/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mesonbuild
   make host-meson
   make
   ```
10. Run the build: `./build.sh x86-64`. If needed, force fresh clone: `rm -rf buildroot_x86-64 && ./build.sh x86-64`.
11. Copy ISO manually if script fails: `cp buildroot_x86-64/output/images/rootfs.iso9660 snakeware_x86-64.iso`.

### Enabling Hardware Acceleration
To add GPU support (Mesa, DRM, SDL2 KMSDRM), append to `external/configs/x86-64_defconfig` (or rpi4_defconfig for Pi):
```
# Hardware Acceleration for Graphics
BR2_PACKAGE_MESA3D=y
BR2_PACKAGE_MESA3D_OPENGL_GL=y
BR2_PACKAGE_MESA3D_OPENGL_ES=y
BR2_PACKAGE_MESA3D_OPENGL_ES2=y
BR2_PACKAGE_MESA3D_OPENGL_EGL=y
BR2_PACKAGE_MESA3D_DRI_DRIVER=y
BR2_PACKAGE_MESA3D_GALLIUM_DRIVER_I915=y  # Add radeonsi or vc4 for other GPUs
BR2_PACKAGE_LIBDRM=y
BR2_PACKAGE_LIBEGL=y
BR2_PACKAGE_LIBGLES=y
BR2_PACKAGE_LIBGBM=y
BR2_PACKAGE_SDL2=y
BR2_PACKAGE_SDL2_KMSDRM=y
```
Rerun `./build.sh x86-64`. Update `snakewm/wm.py` to use kmsdrm and OpenGL flags.

**NOTE:** If you are only contributing apps or other code to snakewm, you don't need to build a whole snakeware distro 
image to test your changes. Simply make your changes to snakewm then run `sudo python wm.py` in the `snakewm/` 
directory. snakewm will then start drawing itself directly to the framebuffer and you can test out your changes. 
Press `ALT+ESC` to return to your normal desktop. (It would still be good to test your changes in an actual
snakeware environment though.)

## Contributing
Developers of all experience levels are welcome and encouraged to contribute to snakeware. Python enthusiasts that are
familiar with pygame and pygame_gui will be able to write their own snakeware apps very easily. See existing apps
in `snakewm/apps/` for examples of how to get started, and feel free to ask questions if you need help.

Those with experience building Linux systems are encouraged to contribute to the underlying aspects of the distro,
such as the build/package scripts and configuration for the kernel, GRUB, etc.

I would also like to eventually stop using Busybox for intialization and find a way to perform all necessary init from
the Python environment, so ideas about that are welcome.

## TODO
This is an abridged list of future plans:

* ~~Raspberry Pi configs for buildroot and kernel!!!!!!!~~
* ~~Fix pip module installation - won't work when cross-compiling~~
* Many more snakewm apps
* ~~App menu for choosing apps to run~~
* ~~Improved/streamlined build system~~
* Improved kernel config
* snake-games - full-screen user games separate from SnakeWM
* ~~Modify partition scheme for faster boot - /usr on its own partition?~~
* Take advantage of pygame_gui's theme functionality
* ~~Dynamic/interactive desktop backgrounds~~
* ~~Sound support~~
* Networking -> web browser
    + snakechat - chat with everyone else who's using snakeware
    + Gopher client?
* Ditch busybox, init via Python somehow
* Optional ModernGL integration for advanced shader-based graphics (add BR2_PACKAGE_PYTHON_MODERNGL=y to defconfig)
* ...
